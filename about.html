            <p>This project was built by the Topic X team for the NTX Global Hackathon 2023.</p>
            <p>The idea behind this project resides in a Neuro-Enhanced e-Learning platform, that takes advantage of a Gamified cognitive learning strategy.</p>
            <p>This optimized learning experience utilizes personalized content driven by brainwaves.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-code"></i>  Why Gamifying?</h2>
            <p><span>Gamify</span> is the process of turning something (such as a task) into a game-like experience in order to encourage participation. </p>
            <p>Cognitive tasks are typically viewed as effortful, frustrating, and repetitive, which often leads to participant disengagement. This, in turn, may negatively impact data quality and/or reduce intervention effects.</p>
            <p>However, gamification may provide a possible solution. If game design features can be incorporated into cognitive tasks without undermining their scientific value, then data quality, intervention effects, and participant engagement may be improved.</p>
